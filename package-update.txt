# React Bootstrap Installation

To use the NotificationCenter component, you need to install react-bootstrap:

```bash
npm install react-bootstrap
```

This package is required for the Dropdown, Badge, and Button components used in the NotificationCenter.

## Implementation Details

The NotificationCenter component has been added to the navigation bar and will be displayed when a user is logged in. It shows a bell icon with a badge indicating the number of unread notifications.

When clicked, it displays a dropdown with a list of notifications. Each notification shows:
- Title
- Message
- Timestamp
- Buttons to mark as read (if unread) and delete

The component interacts with the backend API at:
```
http://localhost:8080/api/notifications
```

## API Endpoints

The NotificationCenter uses the following API endpoints:
- GET /api/notifications/count - Get the count of unread notifications
- GET /api/notifications - Get all notifications
- PUT /api/notifications/{id}/read - Mark a notification as read
- PUT /api/notifications/read-all - Mark all notifications as read
- DELETE /api/notifications/{id} - Delete a notification

## CSS Styles

The necessary CSS styles for the NotificationCenter have been added to App.css. These styles ensure that the notification dropdown and items match the overall design of the application.

## Font Awesome

Font Awesome has been added to the project for the bell icon. It's included via CDN in the index.html file.
